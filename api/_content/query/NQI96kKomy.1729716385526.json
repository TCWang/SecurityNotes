A language model is an AI model that understands human language and has extensive pre-trained knowledge, making it highly capable of solving various natural language processing tasks. Among them, DarkBERT particularly excels in processing and analyzing unstructured data present on the Dark Web. Unlike other similar encoder language models that struggle with the diverse vocabulary and structural diversity found on the Dark Web, DarkBERT has been trained specifically to understand the illicit content present on the Dark Web. Furthermore, DarkBERT enhances its training by fine-tuning RoBERTa models through Masked Language Modeling (MLM) on text collected from the Dark Web."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"development-process-of-darkbert"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Development Process of DarkBERT"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"img","props":{"alt":"e028-01.jpeg","src":"/images/e028-01.jpeg"},"children":[]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"br","props":{},"children":[]},{"type":"element","tag":"h3","props":{"id":"how-to-utilize-darkbert"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"How to Utilize DarkBERT"}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"strong","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Dark Web Page Classification"}]}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"The Dark Web contains numerous pages filled with various types of cybercrime-related content.
