Among them, DarkBERT particularly excels in processing and analyzing unstructured data present on the Dark Web. Unlike other similar encoder language models that struggle with the diverse vocabulary and structural diversity found on the Dark Web, DarkBERT has been trained specifically to understand the illicit content present on the Dark Web.
