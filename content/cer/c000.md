### ISACA Certifications

Founded in 1969, the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA) is a globally recognized and highly respected organization with over 140,000 members in 180 countries. ISACA offers four credentials aimed at different IT pros:

- Certified Information Security Manager (CISM) — Security managers
- Certified in Risk and Information Systems Control (CRISC) — Risk management professionals
- Certified in the Governance of Enterprise IT (CGEIT) — Governance professionals

**CISM**  
A good way to understand CISM is to compare it CISSP. Although both certifications cover cybersecurity and managerial concepts, CISSP focuses on the operational side of security and its technical aspects, while CISM is designed around the strategic side of security and its relations to business goals.

Specifically, CISM is designed for information security managers, targeting individuals who assess, design, manage and oversee information security environments on an enterprise level. Candidates should also possess a thorough understanding of available technologies and how to implement them in their organization. The CISM certification validates a candidate’s skill and knowledge across four domains:

- Domain 1: Information Security Governance
- Domain 2: Information Risk Management
- Domain 3: Information Security Program Development and Management
- Domain 4: Information Security Incident Management

According to ISACA, there are more than 32,000 CISM credential holders worldwide with over 7,500 working as security directors or managers and another 3,500 working as IT directors or managers. Other common CISM roles include IS/IT consultants, CIO, risk management professionals, and enterprise leadership roles.

**CISA**

Typically, CISA professionals hold roles such as IS or IT auditor or audit manager, non-IT auditor, and consultant.

The CISA study process may include attending CISA review classes, enrolling in an online course, or using software, review manuals and study guides. After passing the exam, candidates must also comply with the Information Systems Auditing Standards.

According to the Global Knowledge report, CISA salaries rank number 13, with an average U.S. salary of $97,117.

**CRISC**  
The CRISC credential specifically targets professionals who work with IT risk management at the enterprise level. Typical CRISC candidates include CIOs/CISOs, business analysts, project managers, as well as IT professionals engaged in risk management, control and assurance activities, and compliance.

The CRISC job domains are:

- Domain 1: IT Risk Identification
- Domain 2: IT Risk Assessment
- Domain 3: Risk Response and Mitigation

CRISC requirements include a minimum of three years of work experience in information security program management in two or more of the CRISC job domains, including either Domain 1 or 2.
