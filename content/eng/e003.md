## Foundational Concepts

### Unified Kill Chain

Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain: <a href="https://www.lockheedmartin.com/content/dam/lockheed-martin/rms/documents/cyber/Gaining_the_Advantage_Cyber_Kill_Chain.pdf">Gaining the advantage</a>: Appling Cyber Kill Chain Meghodology to Network Defense.

- 1 Reconnaissance Researching, identifying and selecting targets using active or passive reconnaissance.
- 2 Resource Development Preparatory activities aimed at setting up the infrastructure required for the attack.
- 3 Delivery Techniques resulting in the transmission of a weaponized object to the targeted environment.
- 4 Social Engineering Techniques aimed at the manipulation of people to perform unsafe actions.
- 5 Exploitation Techniques to exploit vulnerabilities in systems that may, amongst others, result in code execution.
- 6 Persistence Any access, action or change to a system that gives an attacker persistent presence on the system.
- 7 Defense Evasion Techniques an attacker may specifically use for evading detection or avoiding other defenses.
- 8 Command & Control Techniques that allow attackers to communicate with controlled systems within a target network.
- 9 Pivoting Tunneling traffic through a controlled system to other systems that are not directly accessible.
- 10 Discovery Techniques that allow an attacker to gain knowledge about a system and its network environment.
- 11 Privilege Escalation The result of techniques that provide an attacker with higher permissions on a system or network.
- 12 Execution Techniques that result in execution of attacker-controlled code on a local or remote system.
- 13 Credential Access Techniques resulting in the access of, or control over, system, service or domain credentials.
- 14 Lateral Movement Techniques that enable an adversary to horizontally access and control other remote systems.
- 15 Collection Techniques used to identify and gather data from a target network prior to exfiltration.
- 16 Exfiltration Techniques that result or aid in an attacker removing data from a target network.
- 17 Impact Techniques aimed at manipulating, interrupting or destroying the target system or data.
- 18 Objectives Socio-technical objectives of an attack that are intended to achieve a strategic goal.

### MITRE ATT&CK framework

<a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&CK</a>: is a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

### Types of Cyberattacks

- Business Email Compromise(BEC)
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Malware Outbreak
- Insider Threats
- Phishing
- Ransomware

### Detection Engineering Definition

Detection engineering can be defined as a set of processes that enable potential threats to be detected within an environment. These processes encompass the end-to-end life cycle, from collecting detection requirements, aggregating system telemetry, and implementing and maintaining detection logic to validating program effectiveness.
