### S2W DarkBert Introduction

According to <a href="https://thereadable.co/korean-security-researchers-introduced-new-ai-and-it-is-sweeping-the-globe-2/">Korean security researchers introduced new AI.</a>,

- Six researchers at the South Korean cybersecurity company **S2W** and the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) conducted joint research to develop an AI model which can understand the language used by cybercriminals on the dark web. The dark web, a vast space of the internet that is not accessible through general web search engines, has been overflowing with jargon cybercriminals use to sidetrack investigators when trading illegal content, such as drugs and counterfeit credit cards.

- The newly introduced model is designed to interpret this kind of jargon by utilizing **BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers)**, a language model released by Google in 2018. BERT works in a similar way to GPT but predicts middle words, while GPT operates by forecasting upcoming words. In other words, BERT is specialized in identifying certain words in a specific context, like on the dark web, while GPT proceeds from left to right, generating the next words.

- The researchers later named the model "DarkBERT," a compound word of the dark web and BERT. Their paper, "**DarkBERT**: A Language Model for the Dark Side of the Internet," was accepted at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) 2023, the world-class academy in natural language processing, awaiting to be presented in Canada this July.

- DarkBERT 就如其名，這套 AI 基於 BERT 與其變體 RoBERTa 所訓練，研究人員透過洋葱路由器 Tor 爬取暗網的資料，然後使用預處理、分析權重等技術，排除那些有明顯的受害者個資後，過濾出原始資料生出了一組暗網數據庫，研究人員再用這組資料庫訓練出 DarkBERT 並發表論文。從論文中的表格可以看到資料庫的站點和類別，除了那些無法辨別的以外，可以看到資料庫以成人圖像、藥物、金流為大宗。

- 研究團隊表示，DarkBERT 可以用在許多像檢測勒索軟體、偵測洩露機敏資料站點，或是即時監控非法資訊等資案用途；**不過目前沒有對外發表的計劃，重點研究資料庫也不會對外公布；但目前可以出於學術目的提出申請使用**。
