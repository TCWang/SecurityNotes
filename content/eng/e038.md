## Preplexity: Summary of the News from Cyber Express: Hackers' OpCandar Declaration

Hackers have recently launched **Operation Canada (OpCanada)**, targeting Canadian organizations amid escalating tensions between India and China. This operation has been attributed to the hacktivist group known as the **Indian Cyber Force**, which has previously engaged in cyberattacks against Bangladesh under a campaign called **OpBangladesh**

The group has begun sharing screenshots of stolen data from Canadian entities, including sensitive personal information such as passports, credit card details, and driver's licenses [1](https://thecyberexpress.com/opcanada-india-china-tensions-escalate/)

### **Key Developments in OpCanada**

- **Data Breaches**: The hackers have claimed to exfiltrate a wide range of personal data from Canadian citizens, including Social Insurance Numbers (SIN), bank statements, and other private information. They reportedly possess a substantial amount of data, with one Telegram post indicating a file size of **24GB**[1](https://thecyberexpress.com/opcanada-india-china-tensions-escalate/).
- **Government Response**: In light of these threats, the **Canadian Centre for Cyber Security** issued an advisory on September 15, 2023, warning about multiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting various levels of the Canadian government and critical sectors like finance and transportation[1](https://thecyberexpress.com/opcanada-india-china-tensions-escalate/). This advisory followed ongoing concerns about cyber threats from state-sponsored actors, particularly those linked to Russia and China.

### **Broader Cybersecurity Context**

The emergence of OpCanada coincides with other significant cybersecurity incidents affecting Canadian governmental networks. For instance, British Columbia's government has reported multiple sophisticated cyberattacks believed to be state-sponsored, highlighting vulnerabilities within its systems

The **Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)** has also noted that Canada remains a target for foreign cyber espionage, particularly from Chinese state-sponsored groups

In addition to these incidents, there have been warnings about the increasing targeting of Canada's critical infrastructure by financially motivated cybercriminals. The **Canadian Centre for Cyber Security** has emphasized the need for robust cybersecurity measures across essential sectors such as health and transportation to mitigate risks associated with outdated technology and human error

### **Conclusion**

The launch of OpCanada underscores the growing complexity and frequency of cyber threats facing Canada. As hacktivist groups exploit geopolitical tensions to further their agendas, both governmental and private sectors must remain vigilant and enhance their cybersecurity protocols to safeguard sensitive information against these evolving threats.

## Preplexity: What specific data did the hackers claim to have stolen from Canadian organizations

The hackers involved in **Operation Canada (OpCanada)** have claimed to have stolen a significant amount of sensitive data from Canadian organizations. According to their announcements and shared screenshots, the specific types of data purportedly exfiltrated include:

- **Personal Identification**: Images of passports and driver's licenses.
- **Financial Information**: Credit card details, bank statements, and information related to loans.
- **Personal Data**: Social Insurance Numbers (SIN), email addresses, phone numbers, and home addresses.
- **Additional Sensitive Information**: Signature samples and photos of Canadian residents.

The hackers have indicated they possess a total of approximately **24GB** of data, which they have threatened to release publicly if their demands are not met

This operation appears to be part of a broader campaign linked to geopolitical tensions, particularly between India and China, and reflects an increase in cyber threats targeting Canada

## Preplexity: How did the hackers obtain access to the third-party database used by Ticketmaster

The hackers gained access to the third-party database used by Ticketmaster through a series of security vulnerabilities primarily involving stolen credentials. Here’s a breakdown of how the breach occurred:

1. **Third-Party Cloud Provider**: The database accessed by the hackers was hosted by **Snowflake**, a cloud-computing service that Ticketmaster utilizes for data storage and analytics. This means the breach did not occur directly within Ticketmaster's own systems but rather through a third-party service[1](https://globalnews.ca/news/10543855/ticketmaster-hack-canadian-data-breach-leak/)[2](https://www.polymerhq.io/blog/ticketmaster-data-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/).
2. **Stolen Credentials**: Cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock reported that the hackers used the stolen credentials of a former Snowflake employee to gain access to the Snowflake data environment. This access allowed them to compromise customer data stored within that system[1](https://globalnews.ca/news/10543855/ticketmaster-hack-canadian-data-breach-leak/)[3](https://www.wired.com/story/epam-snowflake-ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters/).
3. **Remote Access Trojan**: One hacker claimed they initially breached a contractor associated with Snowflake, which led to acquiring unencrypted usernames and passwords stored on an EPAM Systems employee's machine. The credentials were found in a project management tool called Jira, allowing the hackers to log into Snowflake accounts without needing multi-factor authentication (MFA)[3](https://www.wired.com/story/epam-snowflake-ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters/)[4](https://diesec.com/2024/06/ticketmaster-breach/).
4. **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication**: The investigation indicated that many accounts, including those for Ticketmaster, did not have MFA enabled. This lack of additional security measures made it easier for attackers to exploit the stolen credentials and access sensitive data[1](https://globalnews.ca/news/10543855/ticketmaster-hack-canadian-data-breach-leak/)[3](https://www.wired.com/story/epam-snowflake-ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters/)[4](https://diesec.com/2024/06/ticketmaster-breach/).
5. **Broader Campaign**: The hacking group **ShinyHunters**, responsible for this breach, has claimed they stole approximately **1.3 terabytes** of data from Ticketmaster, affecting over **560 million users** globally[2](https://www.polymerhq.io/blog/ticketmaster-data-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/)[5](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw99ql0239wo).

In summary, the breach stemmed from a combination of stolen credentials from a third-party contractor and inadequate security measures like the absence of multi-factor authentication, which allowed unauthorized access to sensitive customer data stored in Snowflake's environment.
