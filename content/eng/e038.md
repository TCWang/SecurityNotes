## Preplexity: Summary of the News from Cyber Express: Hackers' OpCandar Declaration

Hackers have recently launched **Operation Canada (OpCanada)**, targeting Canadian organizations amid escalating tensions between India and China. This operation has been attributed to the hacktivist group known as the **Indian Cyber Force**, which has previously engaged in cyberattacks against Bangladesh under a campaign called **OpBangladesh**

The group has begun sharing screenshots of stolen data from Canadian entities, including sensitive personal information such as passports, credit card details, and driver's licenses [1](https://thecyberexpress.com/opcanada-india-china-tensions-escalate/)

### **Key Developments in OpCanada**

- **Data Breaches**: The hackers have claimed to exfiltrate a wide range of personal data from Canadian citizens, including Social Insurance Numbers (SIN), bank statements, and other private information. They reportedly possess a substantial amount of data, with one Telegram post indicating a file size of **24GB**[1](https://thecyberexpress.com/opcanada-india-china-tensions-escalate/).
- **Government Response**: In light of these threats, the **Canadian Centre for Cyber Security** issued an advisory on September 15, 2023, warning about multiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks targeting various levels of the Canadian government and critical sectors like finance and transportation[1](https://thecyberexpress.com/opcanada-india-china-tensions-escalate/). This advisory followed ongoing concerns about cyber threats from state-sponsored actors, particularly those linked to Russia and China.

## Preplexity: How did the hackers obtain access to the third-party database used by Ticketmaster

The hackers gained access to the third-party database used by Ticketmaster through a series of security vulnerabilities primarily involving stolen credentials. Here’s a breakdown of how the breach occurred:

1. **Third-Party Cloud Provider**: The database accessed by the hackers was hosted by **Snowflake**, a cloud-computing service that Ticketmaster utilizes for data storage and analytics. This means the breach did not occur directly within Ticketmaster's own systems but rather through a third-party service[1](https://globalnews.ca/news/10543855/ticketmaster-hack-canadian-data-breach-leak/)[2](https://www.polymerhq.io/blog/ticketmaster-data-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/).
2. **Stolen Credentials**: Cybersecurity firm Hudson Rock reported that the hackers used the stolen credentials of a former Snowflake employee to gain access to the Snowflake data environment. This access allowed them to compromise customer data stored within that system[1](https://globalnews.ca/news/10543855/ticketmaster-hack-canadian-data-breach-leak/)[3](https://www.wired.com/story/epam-snowflake-ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters/).
3. **Remote Access Trojan**: One hacker claimed they initially breached a contractor associated with Snowflake, which led to acquiring unencrypted usernames and passwords stored on an EPAM Systems employee's machine. The credentials were found in a project management tool called Jira, allowing the hackers to log into Snowflake accounts without needing multi-factor authentication (MFA)[3](https://www.wired.com/story/epam-snowflake-ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters/)[4](https://diesec.com/2024/06/ticketmaster-breach/).
4. **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication**: The investigation indicated that many accounts, including those for Ticketmaster, did not have MFA enabled. This lack of additional security measures made it easier for attackers to exploit the stolen credentials and access sensitive data[1](https://globalnews.ca/news/10543855/ticketmaster-hack-canadian-data-breach-leak/)[3](https://www.wired.com/story/epam-snowflake-ticketmaster-breach-shinyhunters/)[4](https://diesec.com/2024/06/ticketmaster-breach/).
5. **Broader Campaign**: The hacking group **ShinyHunters**, responsible for this breach, has claimed they stole approximately **1.3 terabytes** of data from Ticketmaster, affecting over **560 million users** globally[2](https://www.polymerhq.io/blog/ticketmaster-data-breach-everything-you-need-to-know/)[5](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cw99ql0239wo).

In summary, the breach stemmed from a combination of stolen credentials from a third-party contractor and inadequate security measures like the absence of multi-factor authentication, which allowed unauthorized access to sensitive customer data stored in Snowflake's environment.

### **Key Developments in OpCanada**

- **Targeted Attacks**: The Indian Cyber Force claimed responsibility for disrupting multiple Canadian websites, including those of the **Canadian Armed Forces** and **Elections Canada**. Reports indicate that these sites experienced temporary outages due to **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)** attacks, which flood websites with traffic to render them inaccessible[1](https://thecyberexpress.com/opcanada-india-china-tensions-escalate/)[2](https://www.cyberdaily.au/government/9642-canadian-military-government-websites-targeted-by-indian-cyber-force)[4](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/canadian-armed-forces-website-temporarily-disabled-by-indian-hackers-report-400100-2023-09-28)[5](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/canada-reports-cyber-attacks-from-indian-hackers-amid-worsening-diplomatic-ties/articleshow/104036144.cms).
- **Data Breaches**: The hackers have allegedly exfiltrated sensitive personal information from Canadian citizens, including credit card details, driver's licenses, and other identifying documents. They shared screenshots of stolen data on social media platforms, further escalating the situation[1](https://thecyberexpress.com/opcanada-india-china-tensions-escalate/)[2](https://www.cyberdaily.au/government/9642-canadian-military-government-websites-targeted-by-indian-cyber-force).
- **Government Response**: In response to these attacks, the **Canadian Centre for Cyber Security** issued warnings to organizations about potential cyber threats. They noted an increase in disruptive cyber campaigns linked to geopolitical events, emphasizing the need for vigilance among IT administrators across Canada[3](https://www.itworldcanada.com/article/canada-cyber-centre-issues-caution-after-group-from-india-issues-threat/547488)[5](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/technology/canada-reports-cyber-attacks-from-indian-hackers-amid-worsening-diplomatic-ties/articleshow/104036144.cms).
- **Public Statements by Hackers**: The Indian Cyber Force has publicly framed their actions as a form of retaliation against perceived anti-India sentiments promoted by the Canadian government. They expressed a desire for improved relations between India and Canada while asserting that they do not operate under any government directives[2](https://www.cyberdaily.au/government/9642-canadian-military-government-websites-targeted-by-indian-cyber-force)[4](https://www.businesstoday.in/technology/news/story/canadian-armed-forces-website-temporarily-disabled-by-indian-hackers-report-400100-2023-09-28).

### **Context of Tensions**
