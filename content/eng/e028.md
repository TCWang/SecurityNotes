## DarkBERT - S2W Description

### What is DarkBERT

DarkBERT is the world's first Dark Web-specialized AI language model. A language model is an AI model that understands human language and has extensive pre-trained knowledge, making it highly capable of solving various natural language processing tasks. Among them, DarkBERT particularly excels in processing and analyzing unstructured data present on the Dark Web. Unlike other similar encoder language models that struggle with the diverse vocabulary and structural diversity found on the Dark Web, DarkBERT has been trained specifically to understand the illicit content present on the Dark Web. Furthermore, DarkBERT enhances its training by fine-tuning RoBERTa models through Masked Language Modeling (MLM) on text collected from the Dark Web.

### How to Utilize DarkBERT

**Dark Web Page Classification**

The Dark Web contains numerous pages filled with various types of cybercrime-related content. Automatically classifying pages based on their content within this massive amount of unstructured data is crucial for effective Dark Web intelligence. DarkBERT excels in tasks such as classifying web page content related to topics like pornography, hacking, violence, and more. Detailed information about the page classification system can be found in the paper "Shedding New Light on the Language of the Dark Web" by S2W.

**Detection of Key Threads**

Dark Web forums serve as platforms for sharing information and conducting transactions related to various illegal activities. Since forums allow numerous users to freely create posts, monitoring specific topics can be challenging. Filtering posts to identify key threads (such as sharing confidential information or malicious hacking tools) is essential for effective monitoring. DarkBERT excels in the automatic detection of key forum threads.

**Ransomware Leakage Site Detection**

Ransomware attackers often operate "leakage sites" to publish confidential data from victim companies without negotiation. Swiftly detecting such websites is essential for gathering intelligence on high-risk ransomware groups. DarkBERT demonstrates excellent performance in the automatic detection of leakage sites.

**Inference of Threat Keywords**

Even everyday words can have entirely different meanings on the Dark Web. DarkBERT is trained to understand the jargon and language used by cybercriminals, allowing us to comprehend word usage in context.

### DarkBERT Use Cases

**Use Case 1**: Customer-Specific Fine-Tuning and Classification

DarkBert can be customized and tuned to meet the specific needs of users.It has the capablity to process a vast array of both internal and external unstructured data, enabling it to effectively fiter and refine only the desired information from extensive datasets according to user preferences.

**Use Case 2**: Integration with Open LLM

DarkBERT plays a crucial role in the adootion of Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAl's ChatGPT within the
enterprise. Companies are increasingly seeking to leverage various datasets, both internally and externally, for conversational purposes, where LLMs like ChatGPT generate responses based on this data. To achieve this,
"Retrieval-Augmented Generation"(RAG) technology, which focuses on answer generation through search, has
gained significant attention. Hower, a challenge arises due to the sheer volume of data, strong domain-speciiiliiiic characteristics linduding domain-specitic terminology, and the presence of irrelevant data, leading to reduced search efficiency and accuracy.

**Use Case 3**: Dark Web Specialized Generative AI

DarkCHAT is a specialized generative AI modelinstalled within a Dark Web monitoring solution called XARVIS.
XARVIS required an effective system to refine and present information that users seek within the Dark Web.
DarkCHAT enables users to effectively obtain threat inteligence related to their areas of interest. Leveraging the collected data, DarkCHAT derives new inteligence and grants users access to desired data through single commands.

Unlike commercially avable language models, which cannot directly access the Dark Web and rely on curated
Dark Web news from surface web sources, DarkCHAT stands apart as a real-time generative Al specialized for the
Dark Web. It provides vivid, up-to-the-minute Dark Web information based on data collected from the Dark Web.

"Generative Artficial Intelligence is a technology that generates new data based on given data or inputs. It falls under deep learning and is also referred to generative models. Generative AI can create various types of data. including text, images, audio, video, and more.
