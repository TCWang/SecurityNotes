## Working Strategy

**What: 客戶想要什麼？**

- 藉由專業顧問公司知道資安/網路駭客攻擊情報, 避免公司被攻擊
- 其他？

**How: 如何以有限人力滿足客戶需求**  
策略做法：

- 盡可能收集所有威脅情報提供給客戶:
  - 使用現有工具(ThreatQ, Digital Shadows),
  - 考慮使用下面 ChatGPT 所提供的免費開源網路資原
- 利用 ChatGPT 將所有情報資料做匯總整理為要點提示, 方便客戶閱讀。
- 使用 ChatGPT 翻譯中文威脅情報, 提供中國駭客資訊
- 匯總公司內部資料如 Threat Hunting, XDR 發現的威脅情報！ 提供給 Threat Intelligence 客戶（需要獲得公司授權）
- 藉由專業工具 了解最新 AI 輔助做法：如 SentinelOne Purple AI, 可詢問供應上 Purple 如何做到整合威脅情報？ 主要威脅情報有哪些？如何獲得？
  - Threat Intelligence Integration: Integrates with various threat intelligence feeds and sources to enrich detection capabilities and provide context for identified threats.

強化作業:

- 增購付費工具, 不是最好辦法。需要做充分市場調查。可以使用 ChatGPT 提供的比較分析
- 使用 AI 增加作業效率, 作為長期改善方向。參考 <a href="https://securitynotes.netlify.app/eng/e012">AI Threat Intelligence</a> 中的參考文獻。
