### IBM OSINT

**What is Open-Source Intelligence, OSINT?**  
Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the process of gathering and analyzing publicly available information to assess threats, make decisions or answer specific questions.

Many organizations use OSINT as a cybersecurity tool to help gauge security risks and identify vulnerabilities in their IT systems. Cybercriminals and hackers also use OSINT techniques for social engineering, phishing and exposing targets for cyberattacks.

Beyond cybersecurity, other disciplines such as law enforcement, national security, marketing, journalism and academic research may also make use of open-source intelligence.

**How OSINT works**  
As far back as World War II, highly trained agents in the intelligence community have monitored open-source information such as radio broadcasts, newspapers and market fluctuations. Today, given the number and variety of easily accessible data sources, nearly anyone can participate in open-source intelligence gathering.

**How hackers use OSINT**  
Threat actors often use OSINT to uncover sensitive information they can leverage to exploit vulnerabilities in computer networks.

This may include personal details about an organization’s employees, partners and vendors that are easily accessible on social media and company websites. Or technical information such as credentials, security gaps or encryption keys that may appear in the source code of web pages or cloud applications. There are also public websites that publish compromising information such as stolen logins and passwords from data breaches.

Cybercriminals are able to use this public data for a variety of nefarious purposes.

**OSINT for cybersecurity**  
For these reasons, many organizations conduct OSINT assessments of the public sources of information related to their systems, applications and human resources.

The findings can be used to locate unauthorized leaks of proprietary or sensitive data, evaluate information security, and identify vulnerabilities such as unpatched software, misconfigurations or open ports. Organizations may also conduct penetration testing of their systems and networks using the same OSINT data that are publicly accessible by cybercriminals and hackers.

Often, the information collected during an OSINT assessment is combined with non-public data to create a more comprehensive threat intelligence report. Frequent updates to OSINT cybersecurity assessments can help organizations mitigate the risk of data breaches, ransomware, malware and other cyberattacks.

**OSINT tools**  
Because of the vast amount of public information available, it is often impractical to manually collect, sort and analyze OSINT data. Specialized open-source intelligence tools can help manage and automate data tasks for a variety of OSINT use cases.

Some OSINT analysis tools use artificial intelligence and machine learning to detect which information is valuable and relevant, and which is insignificant or unrelated. Among the more popular OSINT tools are:

- <a href="https://www.osintframework.com/"> Osintframework.com</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) – An extensive directory of free, online OSINT tools and resources hosted on the developer platform GitHub. Both hackers and cybersecurity professionals can use this directory as a starting point to drill down into the specific functionality they seek in an OSINT tool.
- <a href="https://www.maltego.com/"> Maltego</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) – A real-time data mining solution for Windows, Mac and Linux platforms that provides graphic representations of data patterns and connections. With its ability to profile and track the online activities of individuals, this tool can be useful to both cybersecurity professionals and threat actors.
- <a href="https://github.com/smicallef/spiderfoot"> Spiderfoot</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) – A data source integration tool for information such as email addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, subdomains and more. Ethical hackers may use this resource to investigate publicly available information that could pose a threat to an organization or an individual.
- <a href="https://www.shodan.io/"> Shodan</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) – A search engine for internet-connected devices that can also provide information on metadata and open ports. Because this tool can identify security vulnerabilities for millions of devices, it can be useful to both cybersecurity professionals and cybercriminals.
- <a href="https://www.babelstreet.com/"> Babel X</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) – A multilingual, AI-enabled search tool capable of searching the world wide web and dark web in more than 200 languages. Security teams within an organization may use this tool to search for sensitive or proprietary information that may be posted on the dark web or in a foreign country.
- <a href="https://www.metasploit.com/"> Metasploit</a> (link resides outside ibm.com) – A penetration testing tool that can identify security vulnerabilities in networks, systems and applications. Both cybersecurity professionals and hackers find value in this tool because it can expose the specific weaknesses that may enable a successful cyberattack.

### Apply OSINT in Cyter Threat Intelligence

**Key Applications of OSINT in Cyber Threat Intelligence**

1. Threat Detection and Prevention
   OSINT aids in identifying potential threats by monitoring online discussions, forums, and social media for indicators of compromise (IOCs) and emerging attack techniques. This proactive approach allows organizations to take preventive measures before threats escalate into attacks12.
2. Vulnerability Assessment
   By analyzing publicly available information about an organization’s infrastructure, OSINT helps uncover vulnerabilities that malicious actors could exploit. This includes searching for data leaks or misconfigurations that could lead to security breaches24.
3. Understanding Threat Actors
   OSINT provides insights into the motivations, capabilities, and tactics of threat actors, including hackers and state-sponsored groups. This understanding enables CTI professionals to attribute cyber activities to specific adversaries and develop targeted defense strategies13.
4. Monitoring Dark Web Activities
   Security teams can utilize OSINT tools to monitor dark web forums for discussions regarding potential attacks or zero-day vulnerabilities. This intelligence is vital for anticipating threats and mitigating risks associated with leaked credentials or stolen data56.
5. Incident Response Enhancement
   During a cyber incident, OSINT can aid in tracing the origins of threats and understanding attack vectors. This information is crucial for effective incident response, enabling teams to act quickly and efficiently46.
6. Contextual Analysis for Strategic Planning
   By integrating OSINT with internal threat intelligence data, organizations can gain a broader view of the threat landscape, allowing for better prioritization of resources and more informed strategic decisions37.

**Tools and Techniques for Effective OSINT Utilization**
To maximize the benefits of OSINT in CTI roles, professionals can employ various tools and techniques:

- Data Collection Tools: Tools like <a href="https://www.maltego.com/"> Maltego</a>, <a href="https://www.shodan.io/"> Shodan</a>, and <a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/spiderfoot/"> SpiderFoot</a> facilitate the aggregation of relevant data from diverse sources.
- Social Media Monitoring: Platforms such as <a href="https://www.recordedfuture.com/"> Recorded Future</a> help analyze social media trends related to cybersecurity threats.
- Dark Web Monitoring Tools: Tools like <a href="https://www.darkowl.com/"> DarkOwl</a> provide insights into illicit activities that could impact organizational security.
- Automated Scanners: <a href="https://nmap.org/"> Nmap</a> and similar tools can identify network vulnerabilities by scanning for open ports or misconfigured services.

**What is OSINT**

Wikipedia: Open-Source Intelligence, OSINT is data collected from publicly available sources to be used in an intelligence context. In the intelligence community, the tern "open" refers to overt, publicly available sources (as opposed to covert or clandestine sources), it is not related to open-source software or public intelligence.
