## Group 3-Extended Detection and Response, XDR

### What is Extended Detection adn Response, XDR

According to <a href="https://www.trellix.com/security-awareness/endpoint/what-is-xdr/">Trellix</a>:
Extended Detection and Response (XDR) is an evolving security category that can unify threat prevention, detection, and response. XDR solutions ingest data from tools in an organization’s security technology stack to create greater context for Security Operations Center (SOC) teams to perform faster threat detection, investigation, and response.

Key capabilities for XDR include detecting security incidents, automating response capabilities, and integrating intelligence and telemetry data from multiple sources with security analytics to correlate and contextualize security alerts. XDR solutions should include a minimum of two native security sensors and integrate seamlessly with your organization’s security ecosystem.

XDR’s primary advantages are:

- Improved, consolidated visibility: Data is ingested from siloed security solutions so that automated analysis can surface findings from large volumes of data that would otherwise depend on slow, manual processes. Solutions typically include a single point of visibility to unify findings in a single console.
- Faster investigations, more productive SecOps teams: Because XDR prioritizes threats and reduces alert volumes with analytics and correlations, teams can focus on the most critical threat events and leverage automation to address known or repeat events.
- Lower total cost of ownership: XDR vendors with a broad set of native capabilities offer cost savings by standardizing on a security stack from a single vendor, which is typically integrated out-of-the-box. Organizations with a large, best-of-breed environment can unlock data across tools and vendors with XDR solutions that offer open integrations.

XDR holds the promise of consolidating multiple products into a cohesive, unified security incident detection and response system.

**What is the difference between XDR, MDR, and EDR?**

- EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) provides detection and response for endpoints. Many organizations start with EDR and progress to XDR.

- MDR (Managed Detection and Response) provides detection and response as a managed service.

- XDR (Extended Detection and Response) provides detection and response across multiple security controls and data sources.

### How does XDR work?

XDR ingests, correlates, and contextualizes multiple streams of telemetry. XDR can also analyze Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) and other threat vectors to make complex security operations capabilities more accessible to security teams that do not have the resources for heavily customized point solutions. XDR removes the daunting detection and investigation cycles and offers threat-centric and business context to move more quickly to a response to the threat.

XDR security provides advanced threat detection and response capabilities including:

- Detection and response to targeted attacks
- Native support for behavior analysis of users and technology assets
- Threat intelligence including shared local threat intelligence coupled with externally acquired threat intelligence sources
- Reducing the need to chase false positives by correlating and confirming alerts automatically
- Integrating relevant data for faster, more accurate incident triage
- Centralized configuration and hardening capability with weighted guidance to help prioritize activities
- A centralized interface to perform investigations and respond to events
- Playbooks with automation for analysts to establish best practices
- Multi-vector, multi-vendor analytics
- Automation and orchestration to streamline many SOC processes

### Platforms support for XDR

**Carbon Black**  
<a href="https://www.vmware.com/products/endpoint-detection-and-response.html">vmware: Carbon Black EDR</a> <br>
Carbon Black EDR is an incident response and threat hunting solution designed for Security Operations Center teams with offline environments or on-premises requirements. Carbon Black EDR continuously records and stores endpoint activity data so security professionals can hunt threats in real time and visualize the complete attack kill chain, using the Carbon Black Cloud’s aggregated threat intelligence.
