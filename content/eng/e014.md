## SearchGPT 1-Threat Intelligence

## Please provide threat intelligence for this week, 2024/08/07

Here is the most up-to-date threat intelligence report for this week:

1. **Data Breaches and Ransomware Attacks**:
   - **Kroll Data Breach**: A threat actor used a SIM swapping attack to exfiltrate personal information related to the bankruptcy cases of BlockFi, FTX, and Genesis. This involved convincing T-Mobile to transfer a Kroll employee’s phone number to the attacker ([Check Point Research](https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/28th-august-threat-intelligence-report/)).
   - **SEIKO Breach**: The BlackCat ransomware group breached Japanese watch manufacturer SEIKO, threatening to leak stolen files if the ransom is not paid ([Check Point Research](https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/28th-august-threat-intelligence-report/)).
2. **Vulnerabilities and Patches**:
   - **Ivanti Vulnerability**: A critical vulnerability (CVE-2023-38035) in Ivanti's MobileIron Sentry product allows API authentication bypass. Ivanti has released RPM scripts to address it ([Check Point Research](https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/28th-august-threat-intelligence-report/)).
   - **Juniper Networks**: A series of medium-severity vulnerabilities can be combined to create a critical threat of unauthenticated remote code execution. Juniper has released updates to mitigate these vulnerabilities ([Check Point Research](https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/28th-august-threat-intelligence-report/)).
   - **WinRAR Zero-Day**: A newly-discovered WinRAR zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2023-38831) allows threat actors to deliver malware using benign archive files. The latest version of WinRAR addresses this issue ([Check Point Research](https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/28th-august-threat-intelligence-report/)).
3. **Active Threat Actors**:
   - **MoustachedBouncer**: This group targeted foreign diplomats in Belarus, using sophisticated malware dubbed 'Disco' and 'Nightclub' to establish network footholds and exfiltrate data ([BlackBerry](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/solutions/threat-intelligence/2023/threat-intelligence-report-august)).
