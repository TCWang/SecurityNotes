## AI 會議記錄 - 1.錄影/錄音工具使用

To record video meetings on a MacBook, you have several effective methods at your disposal. Here are the most common techniques:

<br>

## **Using Built-in Tools**

### **1. QuickTime Player**

QuickTime Player is pre-installed on macOS and allows for straightforward screen recording.

**Steps:**

- Open QuickTime Player from your Applications folder.
- Click on **File** > **New Screen Recording**.
- Adjust settings by clicking the arrow next to the record button (choose audio input if needed).
- Click the **Record** button, then select either to record the entire screen or a specific portion.
- To stop recording, click the **Stop** button in the menu bar, then save your recording.

This method captures video but may require additional setup to record system audio, such as using plugins like Soundflower

If you're using Zoom and are the host or have permission from the host, you can use its built-in recording feature.

**Steps:**

- Start your meeting in Zoom.
- Click on **Record** in the meeting controls.

### **6. EaseUS RecExperts or Wondershare DemoCreator**

These tools offer user-friendly interfaces with additional editing features.

**Steps:**
