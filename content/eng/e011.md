## Basic Knowledge 3-Extended Detection and Response, XDR

<a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/xdr/xdr-for-dummies.html">Extended Detection and Response (XDR) for Dummies</a> Click here for [ Download](/files/FON-301-XDR-For-Dummies.pdf){target="\_blank" download="FON-301-XDR For Dummies.pdf"}

**Extended Detection and Response, XDR** platforms include tools for orchestration, monitoring and analytics, automation, visualization, and more. What brings it all together is a centralized viewpoint
of your entire security infrastructure.

**Security information and event management, SIEM** and **Security Orchestration Automation and Response, SOAR** solutions share some features with XDR, but there are some key differences. SIEM often can’t properly organize and process all the logs and alerts it generates. SOAR, on the other hand, doesn’t have the integration capabilities that XDR does.

### Chap 1. Security Operations: Trends and Challenges

Biggest threats:

- Ransomware
- Phishing
- Living off the land, LOTL
- Nation state and government level attacks
- Malware and othe viruses
- Insider attacks

While SIEM and SOAR emphasize logs and analysis — what ends up in the hands of security staff — XDR solutions focus on the endpoints themselves. This is where the action is. This is what theoutside parties are attacking.

In this way, XDR shares a lot with **Endpoint Detection and Response, EDR** — notice that this is why XDR couldn’t be called EDR. What XDR does is extend the capabilities of a traditional EDR solution, in addition to deepening the functions of a SIEM or SOAR solution. For example, XDR extends the visibility and detections available with an EDR solution with data and detections from the **Network Detection and Response, NDR** solution.

Components of an XDR solution:

- Flexible integration
- Centralized view
- Artificial intelligence
- Automation

Cisco Secure's Approach:

- X: The platform should cover as many control points and data sources as possible. A security solution is only as good as the vulnerabilities it can cover.
- D: Artificial intelligence-supported analysis is increasingly important for detection and decreasing MTTD.
- R: Automation and centralized security information means faster response times and streamlined security breach investigations.
